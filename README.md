Database Scheme

The database consists of three tables:

1. books: stores information about books (title, author, publisher, publication date, ISBN, and status)
2. members: stores information about library members (name, email, phone, membership date, and expiration date)
3. transactions: stores information about borrowing and returning transactions (transaction date, book ID, member ID, and transaction type)

Key Features

1. Book tracking (title, author, publisher, publication date, ISBN, and status)
2. Member management (name, email, phone, membership date, and expiration date)
3. Transaction tracking (borrowing and returning)
4. Foreign key constraints to maintain data consistency
5. Queries to retrieve information about borrowed books, member transactions, and book availability

SQL Queries

The provided SQL queries:

1. Create the database schema
2. Insert sample data into the tables
3. Update book status and member email
4. Delete a transaction
5. Retrieve all data from each table
6. Retrieve borrowed books and member transactions

Potential Applications

1. Library management
2. Book tracking
3. Member management
4. Transaction history
5. Reporting and analytics

Future Enhancements

1. User authentication and authorization
2. Additional tables for book genres, authors, and publishers
3. More advanced queries for reporting and analytics
4. Integration with a user interface (e.g., web application)
